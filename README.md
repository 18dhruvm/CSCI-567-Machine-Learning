# Key to Quality: Decoding the Language of Keystrokes for Predictive Insight

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between keystroke patterns and the quality of a user's writing. We seek to understand whether keystroke data can be used to predict the quality of a user's writing. This work is the final project for CS 567: Machine Learning at the University of Southern California.

## Data
The data used for this project comes from the [Keystroke Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gakowsher/keystroke-dynamics-benchmark-data-set).
