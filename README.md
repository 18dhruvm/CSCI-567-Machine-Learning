# Key to Quality: Decoding the Language of Keystrokes for Predictive Insight

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between keystroke patterns and the quality of a user's writing. We seek to understand whether keystroke data can be used to predict the quality of a user's writing. This work is the final project for CSCI 567: Machine Learning at the University of Southern California.

## Data
The data used for this project comes from the [Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality/data) Kaggle Competition. 

## Repository Structure

- `/Dataset`: Includes the dataset used in the project.
- `/Docs`: Documentation files, including the project poster and any additional explanatory materials.
- `/Models`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anuranjanpandey/Key-To-Quality.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd keystroke-analysis`
3. Install all packages `conda install --file requirements.txt`
3. After downloading the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality/data), run the notebooks in `Dataset` Folder to get the preprocessed dataframe and time series data to train the LSTM and Transformer models.
4. Use these data frames to train models in the `Models` Folder.



Happy coding!
